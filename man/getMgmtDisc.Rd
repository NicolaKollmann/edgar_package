\description{
\code{getMgmtDisc} retrieves "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of firms from annual statements 
based on CIK numbers and filing year.
}
\details{
getMgmtDisc function takes firm CIK numbers and filing years as input parameters from 
a user and provides "Item 7" section extracted from annual statements along with
filing information. The function imports annual filings downloaded 
via \link[edgar]{getFilings} function; otherwise, it downloads the filings which are 
not already been downloaded. It then reads the downloaded statements, cleans HTML tags, 
and parse the contents. It creates a new directory with name "MD&A section text" 
in the current working directory and saves scrapped "Item 7" sections in this 
directory. It considers "10-K", "10-K405", "10KSB", and "10KSB40" form types as 
annual statements.
